Typically, when people ask this, they are asking about the visualization that lives on the internet inside of our stories. Those visuals are most often coded by our team using front-end web languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). We often rely heavily on the <a href=https://d3js.org/ target=_blank>D3.js</a> JavaScript library and <a href=https://svelte.dev/ target=_blank>Svelte</a>, a component-based framework."},{"type":"text","value":"Some of our static/non-interactive graphics are created using other tools like <a href=https://www.r-project.org/ target=_blank>R</a>, <a href=https://figma.com target=_blank>Figma</a>, or <a href=https://flourish.studio/ target=_blank>Flourish</a>. For interactive maps, we frequently use <a href=https://www.mapbox.com/ target=_blank>Mapbox</a>."},{"type":"text","value":"But before we can create a visualization on the internet, there’s lots of data acquisition, cleaning, and general design involved. You can learn more about our process for those things <a href=https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-1 target=_blank>here</a>, <a href=https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-2 target=_blank>here</a>, or <a href=https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-3 target=_blank>here</a>."}]},{"question":"What other JavaScript libraries do you use?","answer":[{"type":"text","value":"<a href=https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama target=_blank><strong>scrollama</strong></a> for scrollytelling"},{"type":"text","value":"<a href=http://scrollmagic.io/ target=_blank><strong>scrollmagic</strong></a> also for scrollytelling"},{"type":"text","value":"<a href=https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/enter-view target=_blank><strong>enter-view</strong></a> to detect when elements enter the screen"},{"type":"text","value":"<a href=http://d3-annotation.susielu.com/ target=_blank><strong>d3-annotation</strong></a> for annotations in D3.js"},{"type":"text","value":"<a href=https://github.com/hsnaydd/moveTo target=_blank><strong>moveto</strong></a> for scrolling to DOM elements"},{"type":"text","value":"<a href=https://refreshless.com/nouislider/ target=_blank><strong>noUiSlider</strong></a> for cross-browser range sliders"},{"type":"text","value":"<a href=https://lodash.com/ target=_blank><strong>lodash</strong></a> for general JS utilities"}]},{"question":"What skills do you recommend I learn to do what you do?","answer":[{"type":"text","value":"The answer to this question will vary depending on who you ask. For us, we always recommend that people learn how to solve problems (and fail at things) since that’s a huge part of our daily work. It’s also important to be curious about the world."},{"type":"text","value":"As far as technical skills go, we’ve found that it’s more important for you to find tools that you are comfortable with and can use well rather than trying to learn any (or all) specific programming languages. You’ll need to know how to find or collect data, clean messy data, and make accurate data interpretations before you worry too much about making fancy data visualizations. We typically use and recommend R, Python, SQL or Node.js for data collection and processing work. You can find more about our data process <a href=https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-1 target=_blank>here</a>."},{"type":"text","value":"Once you’ve got those skills down in your language of choice, having a good understanding of basic design principles and human perception of data visualization becomes important. Again, we use a wide variety of tools to create our story designs (everything from Google Docs and hand-drawn sketches to software like Figma or Adobe Illustrator). You can find more information about our design process <a href=https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-2 target=_blank>here</a>."},{"type":"text","value":"Then you can work on bringing those designs online. If your hope is to create interactive graphics for the internet, you will need to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We often use D3.js, a JavaScript library, but we recommend understanding the fundamentals of web development before trying to pick it up. Many forms of data visualization can be created without the use of D3."}]},{"question":"What is your process for writing a data story?","answer":[{"type":"text","value":"You can find our process in its entirety <a href=https://github.com/the-pudding/FYI/wiki/Editorial-Process target=_blank>here</a>. In short, we each keep a backlog of story ideas (you can find our public one <a href=https://pudding.cool/backlog/ target=_blank>here</a>) and then routinely pitch those ideas to the rest of the team. Our story ideas tend to take the form of a question that we will then attempt to answer using data. The team provides feedback and then the author can decide which idea(s) to pursue."},{"type":"text","value":"They then find/collect/analyze data, determine whether they have successfully answered their driving question (or if they should change course to a different question). See how that flow works <a href=https://pudding.cool/process/pivot-continue-down/ target=_blank>here</a>. Once the data has been analyzed, the author creates a storyboard of how they imagine the story to go with any graphics needed to help the reader understand the topic at hand. Read more about how we think about storytelling <a href=https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-make-dope-shit-part-3/ target=_blank>here</a>. Last, the story is coded out and put on the internet."}]},{"question":"How long do projects take?","answer":"Our projects usually take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to complete."},{"question":"Do you release your data or code?","answer":[{"type":"text","value":"Yup! Whenever possible, we release our data and data analysis scripts in a <a href=https://github.com/the-pudding/data target=_blank>GitHub repo</a> for public use."},{"type":"text","value":"We also have a public <a href=https://github.com/the-pudding target=_blank>GitHub repo</a> for our front-end builds."}]}]}
